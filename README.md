# Initial 3BC Syntax Highlight Support

3BC is a low-level, easy-to-learn programming language that works in the form of a virtual machine similar to a 1960s computer, but with a very unusual architecture that has processors of only 3 bits.

Despite having an aspect to be an esoteric language, it has a good capacity for generic use to solve computational problems, and certain advantages with the implementation in embedded and microcontrollers.

It was introduced by a Brazilian at Christmas 2020 after completing a month of development, being a project for studies and also as a conceptual proof of concept about punched cards being readable and practical for both humans and machines.
